 Accordingly, we identified the 100 best universities in the 2014
 <a href="http://www.shanghairanking.com/ARWU2014.html" target="_blank">
  Academic Ranking of World Universities,
 </a>
 better known as the “Shanghai Ranking.” Taking the Shanghai Ranking as our point of departure, we researched the most important characteristics of each of the top 100 universities on the list in order to reveal
 <em>
  why
 </em>
 each university appears where it does.
</p>
<p>
 How do American universities stack up against the competition overseas? Next to each university in our ranking is the country where the university resides. The country that you’ll find overwhelmingly represented is the United States. Indeed, over half of the world’s hundred best universities (52 to be exact) are in the U.S.
</p>
<p>
 As you scan this list, you’ll notice some interesting things. Of the top ten universities in the world, the top eight are in the United States. Most of the Ivy League schools are on the list. Also, most of the University of California campuses are on this list as well.
</p>
<p>
 To assist our readers in seeing how American universities compare to themselves, we also include, in brackets, the relative rankings of U.S. universities.

  Harvard is #1 in The 100 Best Universities in the World!
 </a>
</aside>
<p>
 Harvard University is the standard by which all other research universities are measured. No school has ever challenged its position as the world’s premier academic institution in the history of the Shanghai rankings.
</p>
<p>
 Founded in 1636 (only 16 years after the
 <em>
  Mayflower
 </em>
 touched down at Plymouth Rock), Harvard is the oldest school in the world’s richest nation, and it has capitalized on the benefits this grants. Under manager Jack Meyer’s leadership, the school’s endowment fund grew from $4.6 billion to $25.8 billion in 15 years. Today, the university possesses over $36 billion, and its fortune is still growing.
</p>
<p>
 But there is much more to Harvard than massive wealth. The school has produced 47 Nobel Laureates, 32 heads of state, and 48 Pulitzer Prize winners. It boasts the largest academic library in the world (Widener Library, home to some 6 million volumes), as well as leading medical, law, and business schools. It has an integrated alumni network that stretches around the globe.
</p>
<p>
 It would be invidious to single out any of Harvard’s many academic departments for its excellence, for the school’s principal claim on the #1 position lies in the fact that it is at or very near the top in nearly every field across the entire spectrum of the sciences and the humanities!
</p>
<p>
 Not only is Harvard dominant across a multitude of academic fields, it is also ideally situated to work alongside a variety of other schools. The most obvious example is MIT, but the greater Boston metropolitan area is also home to Boston College, Boston University, Northeastern, Tufts, Brandeis, and several other research universities. This fact equips both students and faculty with endless opportunities for collaborative research.

<p>
 With an $18.7 billion endowment Stanford has access to numerous world-class research resources.
</p>
<p>
 The school’s 1,189 acre Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve lets scientists study ecosystems first hand. Its 150-foot radio telescope, nicknamed “The Dish,” studies the ionosphere.
</p>
<p>
 Stanford also boasts a 315-acre habitat reserve which is actively trying to bring back the endangered California tiger salamander. And the SLAC Accelerator Laboratory actively advances the U.S. Department of Energy’s research.
</p>
<p>
 Stanford is also affiliated with the prestigious Hoover Institution, which is one of the nation’s leading social, political, and economic think tanks.
</p>
<p>
 But it takes more than just great laboratories and facilities to build a great research center. Stanford also has some of the finest minds in the world working for it. The school’s faculty currently include 22 Nobel Laureates, 51 members of the American Philosophical Society, three Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients, 158 National Academy of Science members, five Pulitzer Prize winners, and 27 MacArthur Fellows.

 </a>
</aside>
<p>
 In the century and a half since its founding in 1861, MIT has become the world’s preeminent science research center.
</p>
<p>
 The university is known for a focused approach that uses first-class methodologies to tackle world-class problems. This pragmatic creativity has produced legions of scientists and engineers, as well as 80 Nobel Laureates, 56 National Medal of Science winners, 43 MacArthur Fellows, and 28 National Medal of Technology and Innovation winners.
</p>
<p>
 Nevertheless, the school’s more than $10 billion endowment still leaves plenty of room for the arts and humanities. This is why MIT Press can publish 30 prestigious journals and 220 state-of-the-art books every year. Since 1899,
 <em>
  MIT Technology Review
 </em>
 has continuously researched developing trends in the industrial sciences and other related fields, making their publications essential for anyone trying to understand where future innovation is headed.
</p>
<p>
 Notable people affiliated with MIT include Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin, father of linguistics Noam Chomsky, former U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, and former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke.

  UC Berkeley is #4 in The 100 Best Universities in the World!
 </a>
</aside>
<p>
 Berkeley is unique among the elite universities of the world. Most of the schools it competes with are privately owned, but Berkeley is a state school—albeit one with the elite status of a private school.
</p>
<p>
 The university is nestled in a pleasant city by the same name, within easy commuting distance of San Francisco. With over 36,000 students, Berkeley is also one of the larger elite universities.
</p>
<p>
 An impressive selection of talented students feeds its over 350 degree programs, producing more Ph.D.’s annually than any other U.S. institution. Student research is encouraged as each year 52 percent of seniors assist their professors in their research.
</p>
<p>
 Berkeley draws students from over 100 nations. During the previous decade the National Science Foundation granted its students more graduate research fellowships than any other school.
</p>
<p>
 The faculty has produced 39 members of the American Philosophical Society, 77 Fulbright Scholars, 32 MacArthur Fellows, and 22 Nobel Laureates (eight of whom are current faculty members).

  Cambridge is #5 in The 100 Best Universities in the World!
 </a>
</aside>
<p>
 As one of the oldest universities in the world (founded in 1209), Cambridge is an ancient school steeped in tradition.
</p>
<p>
 It is small exaggeration to say the history of western science is built on a cornerstone called Cambridge. The roster of great scientists and mathematicians associated with the university includes Francis Bacon, Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, James Clerk Maxwell, Augustus De Morgan, Ernest Rutherford, G.H. Hardy, Srinivasa Ramanujan, Alan Turing, Francis Crick, James Watson, Roger Penrose, and Stephen Hawking. Whether speaking of the unifying ideas in physics, the foundations of computer science, or the codifying of biology, Cambridge has been at the forefront of humanity’s quest for truth longer than most nations have existed.
</p>
<p>
 Of course, great achievements are not restricted to the sciences. Such luminaries in the humanities as Desiderius Erasmus, John Milton, G.E. Moore, Bertrand Russell, Ludwig Wittgenstein, John Maynard Keynes, and C.S. Lewis, among dozens of other great names, taught and studied here.
</p>
<p>
 But despite the many memories conjured by its imposing Gothic architecture, Cambridge does not live in the past. The university remains one of the world’s elite research institutions, with only Oxford to rival it in the U.K. and only a handful of American schools able to do so from overseas.
</p>
<p>
 Its over 18,000 students represent more than 135 countries and its faculty have earned over 80 Nobel laureates.

 Princeton University is one of the oldest, most historic universities in the United States. Its famous Nassau Hall (right) still bears a cannonball scar from the 1777 Battle of Princeton, and its former president, John Witherspoon, was the only University president to sign the Declaration of Independence.
</p>
<p>
 The school’s nearly three-century history has given it ample time to develop an impressive $18.2 billion endowment. But unlike the other big institutions it competes with—such as Yale, Harvard, and Stanford—Princeton spreads its considerable wealth across a far smaller number of students and programs.
</p>
<p>
 Princeton has no law school, medical school, business school, or divinity school. Instead of developing professional programs, it has self-consciously evolved into a massive, research-driven think tank.
</p>
<p>
 Whereas other schools typically direct their elite faculties’ attention towards graduate students, Princeton expects its professors to teach students of various academic levels. Furthermore, Princeton, more so than many other leading institutions, continues to challenge its students with a difficult grading scale. Even brilliant valedictorians who come here from around the country find that they need to focus on their studies.

 Any school can assign a textbook for you to read on your own, but research universities pride themselves on giving you the opportunity to work alongside leaders in their respective fields who
 <em>
  write
 </em>
 the textbooks.
</p>
<p>
 Of course, in order to do this efficiently a school needs a decent student/faculty ratio. Few schools can beat Caltech’s three-to-one ratio—which is one of the many reasons why this relatively young school has risen to international prominence.
</p>
<p>
 Its faculty includes 33 Nobel Laureates, 58 National Medal of Science recipients, 13 National Medal of Technology and Innovation recipients, and 111 National Academy of Science members.
</p>
<p>
 But to gain access to this prestigious collection of brilliant professors you will have to be the best of the best. Six thousand six hundred twenty-five applicants compete to be one of the 226 members of the freshman class—which is why 98 percent of the student body graduated in the top 10 percent of their class.
</p>
<p>
 These students and teachers can also study at some of the school’s world-famous research centers, such as the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the Seismological Laboratory, and the International Observatory Network.

 As one of the colonial colleges and the fifth-oldest school in the United States, Columbia has a lot of history. That history has created an internationally recognized, elite university with an $8.2 billion endowment and a library containing nearly 13 million volumes.
</p>
<p>
 Columbia University is spread across five distinct campuses in New York City, including Columbia College, the undergraduate division. In 2013, 26,376 students applied for 1,751 admittances to Columbia College.
</p>
<p>
 The university’s medical school—the College of Physicians and Surgeons, which was founded in 1767—produced the first M.D.’s in the 13 colonies. The school now graduates nearly 1,400 doctors per year.
</p>
<p>
 Columbia is the leading university in the New York metropolitan area, which gives its students numerous unique opportunities that only proximity to Wall Street, the U.N., Broadway, and other epicenters of finance, politics, and culture can bring. The university’s ideal location also gives its students the chance to interact with various other respected institutions, such as New York University.
</p>
<p>
 Eighty-two Columbians have won a Nobel Prize at some point in their careers.

 The University of Chicago was only founded in 1890, making it one of the youngest elite universities in the world. But despite its youth, the school has spearheaded many of the world’s most important scientific achievements.
</p>
<p>
 It was here that Italian physicist Enrico Fermi created the world’s first controlled, self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction in 1942. It was likewise at Chicago that Stanley Miller and Harold Urey demonstrated in 1952 that amino acids essential to life could be produced starting from simple molecules such as methane and ammonia, thus founding the entire field of what has come to be known as “origin of life” research. Today, the university is one of the leading universities building on the work of its famous alum, James Watson, in the exploration of the human genome.
</p>
<p>
 But Chicago is not just a science school. It also possesses great depth, with elite programs in the humanities and the social sciences, including its world-renowned Economics Department and its interdisciplinary gathering of highly distinguished thinkers known as the Committee on Social Thought.
</p>
<p>
 Of Chicago’s 89 Nobel Prize winners, 22 have been in economics, which is remarkable given that the economics prize was only first awarded in 1969 (45 years ago at the time of this writing). Perhaps this is one reason why the university weathered the 2008 financial crisis relatively well!
</p>
<p>
 In any case, the school’s approximately $7 billion endowment is now rapidly growing once more, assuring the continuation of the ample research opportunities it provides its faculty and students well into the future.

 Oxford University traces its origins back to the 13th century. With its intellectual roots firmly planted in medieval scholasticism, Oxford has survived the centuries, adapted to the times, and grown into what it is today—one of the world’s most impressive centers of learning.
</p>
<p>
 Perhaps more than any other school in the world, Oxford’s name has become synonymous with knowledge and learning. This is because the school runs the world’s largest—and arguably most prestigious—academic press, with offices in over 50 countries.
</p>
<p>
 One in five people who learn English worldwide do so with Oxford University Press materials. This international appeal may explain why almost 40 percent of the student body comes from outside the U.K.
</p>
<p>
 Oxford’s academic community includes 80 Fellows of the Royal Society and 100 Fellows of the British Academy. Over 17,200 people applied for 3,200 undergraduate places in 2014.
</p>
<p>
 However, despite thousands of undergraduate students willing to pay full tuition and centuries of accumulated assets, the highest source of income for Oxford continues to be research grants and contracts.

 Yale University has everything one would expect from a major research university: it is one of the eight original Ivy League schools; it has a $20 billion endowment; and roughly one in six of its students come from foreign nations.
</p>
<p>
 Yale has also had a disproportionate influence on American politics. Numerous major U.S. political careers have begun at Yale—the school’s notorious Skull and Bones secret society has produced three Presidents—and Yale Law School has been the preeminent law school in the country for years.
</p>
<p>
 The university’s research centers address topics as varied as Benjamin Franklin’s writings, bioethics, magnetic resonance research, and the Russian archives.
</p>
<p>
 Whereas many other elite institutions develop areas of specialization—be it Caltech’s and MIT’s focus on science and technology or Princeton’s focus on pure research—Yale is equally dominant in the humanities, the sciences, and the learned professions. This gives the school a unique ability to pursue interdisciplinary research.
</p>
<p>
 Yale also enjoys a flexible alumni network that stretches to every corner of the globe.

</p>
<p>
 Today, the university can claim 13 Nobel Laureates, 12 Rhodes Scholars, 12 MacArthur Fellows, 10 National Medal of Science winners, three Pulitzer Prize winners, and a Fields Medalist.
</p>
<p>
 UCLA has also produced numerous athletic achievements, with over 111 NCAA championships, 110 professional athletes, dominance over the No. 1 pick in the major league drafts, and 250 Olympic medals.

 With a roughly $3 billion endowment and a budget exceeding $4.5 billion, UCLA has recovered rapidly from the 2008 financial crisis. Its substantial research funds are a part of the reason why over 100 companies have been created based on technology developed at the school.

 Cornell University is a sprawling city of scholarship that seems almost out of place amid the rolling upstate New York countryside.
</p>
<p>
 Typically, schools numbering in the tens of thousands are integrated into much larger cities. Thus, in many ways Cornell has both the air of a quaint college nestled in the woods and the endless opportunity characteristic of urban centers.
</p>
<p>
 But Cornell is not limited by its beautiful upstate campus. It also runs one of the nation’s leading medical schools in New York City. Moreover, the university is among the most active schools in seeking out international connections. In 2001, it started the first American medical school outside the states, in Qatar, and continues to develop strong ties with China, India, and Singapore.
</p>
<p>
 Cornell is building itself into a transnational hub of intellectual inquiry. It has also developed multiple interdisciplinary research centers in nanotechnology, biotechnology, genomics, and supercomputing.
</p>
<p>
 The university was also the first to build entire colleges for hotel administration, labor relations, and veterinary medicine.

  UC San Diego is #14 in The 100 Best Universities in the World!
 </a>
</aside>
<p>
 With a roughly $750 million endowment and over 30,000 students, no one would ever expect that the University of California at San Diego is younger than many of its faculty members.
</p>
<p>
 The school lies on the frontiers of knowledge despite being founded in 1960. It is also unique in that unlike many of the private schools it competes with, UC San Diego is a public school with competitive costs. In-state students pay only $13,302 for tuition, and even out-of-state students will typically save $10,000 or more per year.
</p>
<p>
 The school is one of the 10 largest centers for scientific research in America, which is why it has attracted 16 Nobel Laureates to teach there during the past 50 years.
</p>
<p>
 Over 650 companies were launched or utilize technology developed at UC San Diego and, as of 2013, the university’s Technology Office managed over 400 license agreements. This propensity for innovation has been especially productive in the increasingly lucrative field of biotechnology.
</p>
<p>
 Besides being ranked 14th in the world overall, UC San Diego is also ranked 15th for scientific impact (according to the Center for Science and Technology Studies), sixth for happiest freshmen in America (CBS News), and first for positive impact on the world (
 <em>
  Washington Monthly
 </em>
 ).

 University of Washington’s $2.1 billion endowment combines with 54,000 students paying state school tuition via three campuses and distance learning. This combination makes the school a top-notch research center available to the masses.
</p>
<p>
 The university runs several highly respected professional schools in medicine, engineering, business, and law.
</p>
<p>
 However, unlike many schools of its size and caliber, UW does not forget about its undergraduates. They enjoy a low 11:1 student-to-teacher ratio, as well as an annual undergraduate research symposium. The university also boasts an impressive 93 percent freshman retention rate.
</p>
<p>
 UW has launched multiple prominent social research centers such as the Diversity Research Institute, the Center for Women’s Health and Gender Research, the Institute for Ethnic Studies in the U.S., and the West Coast Poverty Center.
</p>
<p>
 The school has produced 35 Rhodes Scholars and seven Marshall Scholars. Moreover, four current professors and three alumni have won the Nobel Prize, and over 130 have become Fulbright Scholars.

 The University of Pennsylvania (universally known as “Penn”) is an Ivy League school dating back to 1740. To this day, the university—which has become an integral part of the city of Philadelphia—carries forward the practical curiosity of its founder, Benjamin Franklin, in a wide spectrum of fields.
</p>
<p>
 Penn is extremely diverse. Of the class of 2017, 50 percent of the student body is black, Hispanic, Asian, or Native American. The school also has just under 500 international students.
</p>
<p>
 The faculty include 84 Academy of Arts and Sciences members, 81 Institute of Medicine members, 33 National Academy of Science members, 31 American Philosophical Society members, 175 Guggenheim Fellowship recipients, and 12 National Academy of Engineering members.
</p>
<p>
 These first-class thinkers power the school’s more than 100 research centers and institutes, and direct much of its $8 billion endowment.
</p>
<p>
 The school owns 357 buildings spread over 994 acres, in addition to its own teaching hospital.

<p>
 Many of the universities on this list began their existence as small schools aimed primarily at religious instruction. Johns Hopkins is different—it was designed from its inception to be at the forefront of scientific discovery.
</p>
<p>
 The university operates what is widely regarded as the world’s leading medical school. As such, it has received more extramural National Institutes of Health awards than any other medical research institution in the country. Which is the main reason why the school receives more federal research funds than any competitor.
</p>
<p>
 But Johns Hopkins is much more than just a medical school. The university as a whole also receives more federal research and development dollars than any other school—which helps it to further such prestigious institutions as the School of Advanced International Studies, the Carey Business School, and the Whiting School of Engineering.
</p>
<p>
 Its faculty members include 51 American Academy of Arts and Sciences fellows, 61 Institute of Medicine members, 28 National Academy of Science members, and four Nobel Prize winners.

<p>
 The vast majority of universities on this list take a broad-brush approach to education: they have a variety of departments dedicated to the study of law, art, and the humanities, in addition to science. Some—such as MIT or Cal Tech—are known for specializing in the natural sciences.
</p>
<p>
 However, the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF) is the world’s highest-ranked research university focused on only one field of study: namely medicine. The school is the only one within the 10-campus-wide University of California system dedicated solely to the health sciences.
</p>
<p>
 But what UCSF  lacks in versatility it more than makes up for in research success. Its more than 3,000 students are divided into divisions studying medicine, nursing, pharmacy, or graduate research, each of which is commended as a national leader in its respective field.
</p>
<p>
 UCSF’s  all-professional/graduate level student body lends a seriousness to the school often compromised at large state schools. Five Nobel Laureates teach at this $1.9 billion institution.

 The Swiss Federal Institute of Technology—widely known by its German acronym ETH—is the leading university in Switzerland and the highest-ranked school on the continent of Europe.
</p>
<p>
 Once the home of Albert Einstein, today ETH draws over 18,000 students from roughly 80 countries (36.9 percent of its students are foreign), who study in both German and English. Twenty-one Nobel Laureates are associated with the school.
</p>
<p>
 ETH is especially well-connected to the private sector. It produces approximately 80 new patents a year. The school also helps its scientists develop and market the products of their research, and has consequently paved the way for hundreds of spin-off companies.
</p>
<p>
 The university has special strengths in the areas of energy supply, risk management, city development, global food security, and international health.
</p>
<p>
 ETH also benefits from its location within one of Europe’s leading cultural centers. Zurich has the reputation of a clean and pleasant place, which is why it has long been ranked as the city with the world’s highest standard of living.
</p>
<p>
 ETH also benefits from its proximity to another major research institution, the University of Zurich.

<p>
 Moreover, the school’s past and present students and faculty members have earned 29 Nobel Prizes (40, if you include research fellows and honorary graduates). Two alumni and one current faculty member have earned the coveted Fields Medal in mathematics.
</p>
<p>
 UCL ranks third among U.K. schools for national funding. It has also recently linked efforts with Yale to form a transatlantic research initiative called the Yale UCL collaborative.
</p>
<p>
 The school also runs multiple interdisciplinary research programs, such as the UCL Energy Institute, the UCL Centre for Multidisciplinary &amp; Intercultural Inquiry, and the UCL Cancer Institute.
</p>

<p>
 University of Tokyo has made many strides in an effort to become an internationally renowned research center. In 2012, the school developed PEAK, or “Programs in English at Komaba,” and now attracts students from over 100 nations.
</p>
<p>
 University of Tokyo runs numerous research institutes studying multiple fields, including medical science, earthquakes, Asian culture, molecular bioscience, cosmic ray research, solid state physics, and environmental science. The school has produced seven Nobel Prize winners and one Field’s Medalist.
</p>
<p>
 The university has also fully utilized its strategic location in the world’s largest city, and has had a major impact on the domestic front. Fifteen Japanese Prime Ministers have come from University of Tokyo.
</p>
<p>
 The school’s influence on the Japanese government has been so extensive that former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa felt the need to order government agencies to reduce their percentages of University of Tokyo alumni to under 50 percent in order to promote diversity!

 What MIT is to the U.S., Imperial College London is to the U.K.
</p>
<p>
 This university—whose full, official name is “Imperial College of Science, Technology, and Medicine”—focuses on the empirical disciplines. It ascended to prominence by absorbing several smaller institutions, including the Royal College of Chemistry, the Royal School of Mines, the Royal College of Science, and the City and Guilds College.
</p>
<p>
 Along the way, multiple medical facilities also joined with Imperial College, until now the university represents a conglomeration of research centers spread out across several campuses. Today, Imperial College is divided into three main schools: Engineering; Natural Science and Medicine; and Business.
</p>
<p>
 Imperial College’s faculty has laid claim to 14 Nobel Prizes, and the Queen and the Prime Minister share the same physician who teaches there.
</p>
<p>
 Imperial College is also ideally situated to work alongside of University College London, and to tap into the massive political and economic power associated with the U.K.’s capital city.

 University of Toronto is the leading Canadian research university. Even by the standards of large state schools, this institution is utterly massive, with over 80,000 students, 20,000 faculty and staff, and 530,000 alumni around the world.
</p>
<p>
 Students can choose from 215 different graduate, 60 professional, and more than 700 undergraduate degrees spread over three different campuses. The student body represent over 150 nations.
</p>
<p>
 Toronto has 44 libraries with holdings of over 21 million in all. The school has an operating budget of C$1.9 billion and contributes C$15.7 billion to the Canadian economy every year.
</p>
<p>
 Toronto has produced no fewer than 10 Nobel Prize winners, including the first two from Canada. Given its immense size and resources, coupled with the world-class intellects it attracts, it should come as no surprise that Toronto ranks second among North American universities for faculty publications and third for citations.
</p>
<p>
 The university’s ample research leads to dozens of new patents every year and many new technological spin-offs.

 The University of Wisconsin’s flagship campus at Madison is a large public school comprising 40,000 students divided into 13 schools and colleges, supported by a $2 billion-plus endowment (third in the U.S. for research expenditures).
</p>
<p>
 Speaking of its impressive budget, the university has recently invested a lot of money in new facilities. In 2010, it built the Wisconsin Institute for Discovery, which is designed for biomedical research. In 2012, it added a 200,000-square-foot addition to its Human Ecology Building. And in 2013, it opened the Wisconsin Energy Institute for advancing alternative energy technology.
</p>
<p>
 However, University of Wisconsin represents more than state-of-the-art facilities. For over 100 years, this school has also developed a tradition of public service. Besides a vast collection of research programs directed towards more specific problems, the school’s Morgridge Center for Public Service has also engaged such broad social issues as poverty, inequality, and globalization.

 In 1897, Kyoto University became the second university founded in Japan. Within a decade, the school added programs in science, engineering, law, medicine, and humanities.
</p>
<p>
 The university, which is divided among three campuses, now has 17 graduate schools, 14 research institutes, 21 research/educational centers, and 10 faculties.
</p>
<p>
 Eight of the 22 Japanese Nobel Prize Laureates have been affiliated with Kyoto. The school is also home to two Fields Medalists, as well as Gauss Prize winners and recipients of the Japan Prize.
</p>
<p>
 Kyoto University has also recently received several major donations. In 2007, Japanese entrepreneur Tetsuro Funai gave the school enough funding to establish the Tetsuro Funai Auditorium and the Funai Center. Just three years later, Canon gave the school $4.89 million for the Advanced Medical Device Development and Clinical Research Center. Currently, the school has a $2.2 billion endowment.
</p>
<p>
 Kyoto University runs multiple research centers, including the Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics, the Research Institute for Mathematical Sciences, the Primate Research Institute, the Kosobe Conservatory, and the Seto Marine Biological Laboratory.

 New York University (NYU), located in the Washington Square neighborhood adjacent to Greenwich Village, pursues academic excellence while striving to be as diverse as the city it resides in. Eight-seven different foreign nations and 48 states are represented in its freshman class alone.
</p>
<p>
 NYU also sends more students abroad than any other American school. Even in the present unpredictable economic atmosphere, 83 percent of the graduating class leave with jobs. This number increases to 94 percent employed or in graduate school within six months of commencement.
</p>
<p>
 Furthermore, the average starting salary of recent graduates is an impressive $53,350. Almost half of the graduating class will receive multiple job offers.
</p>
<p>
 NYU has also expanded into two foreign countries, with campuses in Shanghai (China) and Abu Dhabi (United Arab Emirates). Students can choose from over 230 areas of study and enjoy an intimate 10:1 student-to-faculty ratio.

 Northwestern University’s 21,000 students enjoy three campuses, two of which border on Lake Michigan, while the third resides in Doha, Qatar. These campuses house 12 schools and colleges.
</p>
<p>
 The school employs a prestigious 3,344-strong full-time faculty that currently includes a Nobel Prize winner, MacArthur Fellowship winners, and Tony Award winners. The university is also known for its 19 teams’ presence within the Big Ten athletic conference.
</p>
<p>
 Its $9.8 billion endowment is why the school can afford to utilize more than $500 million for research in a given year, and why its library can hold over 5 million items, including numerous journals and microforms.
</p>
<p>
 As often seems to be the case, this leading research university benefits from its close proximity to an even stronger neighbor, the University of Chicago.
</p>

 In the modern world, many marvel at the technological advances of science. The University of Illinois prides itself on a deep commitment to this progress through the kind of interdisciplinary research done at the Applied Research Institute—which brings together a wide assortment of engineers—or the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology—which unites a multitude of fields such as biology, computation, and physics—as well as the Academy for Entrepreneurial Leadership—which helps propagate the university’s nearly $2 billion endowment.
</p>
<p>
 Yet, the school also utilizes much more focused research programs. These more specialized research programs include the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies and the European Union Center.
</p>
<p>
 This is why the University of Illinois, whose flagship campus is located at Urbana-Champaign, has produced 22 Noble Laureates and 22 Pulitzer Prizes. Famous Illinois alumni include many wealthy, successful people such as Oracle founder Larry Ellison,
 <em>
  Playboy
 </em>
 founder Hugh Hefner, and two of You Tube’s three founders.

 The University of Minnesota has more people than most armies in history had soldiers. With just under 70,000 students, 25,000 faculty administering instruction, and an alumni network of over 400,000, Minnesota’s web of influence has encircled the globe. The school now impacts Minnesota’s economy to the tune of $8.6 billion annually.
</p>
<p>
 This combination of massive financial resources and legions of brilliant minds is why Minnesota has no less than 325 research centers and institutes, giving students the opportunity to pursue their passions no matter where they lead.
</p>
<p>
 The university, whose flagship campus is located in the “Twin Cities” of Minneapolis-St. Paul, has developed an especially successful medical research program through its children’s hospital and biomedical library.
</p>
<p>
 Typically, one would expect a school of Minnesota’s size and prominence to be driven by publications and patents. However, in spite of its size the university has maintained a compassionate touch. In addition to its children’s hospital, the school also runs an extremely successful education program for students in grades K–12. This allows future educators, parents, and children to learn about learning while learning about everything else. As a result, Minnesota stands at the forefront of education research.

 Duke is especially well known for its two most prestigious professional programs. The first is Duke’s medical program which includes the Duke University Health System, Medical School, Nursing School, and Duke Hospital, all working in partnership. The second is the university’s well-rated law school, which consistently ranks among the top 10 in the country (and has never dropped out of the prestigious top 14). Given these two areas of expertise, it is not surprisingly that Duke runs one of the world’s most sought-after dual J.D./M.D. programs.
</p>

 Many universities try to study as wide a range of subjects as possible. Rockefeller University is different. More than any other school in the world’s top 100, Rockefeller specializes in bioscience and medical research.
</p>
<p>
 The areas of biology that its departments focus on range from stem cells to neuroscience, and from biochemistry to structural biology.
</p>
<p>
 Twenty-four Nobel Prizes have been connected to Rockefeller, as well as 21 Lasker Awards, 20 National Medals of Science, 16 members of the Institute of Medicine, 33 members or foreign associates of the National Academy of Sciences, and 18 recipients of the Canadian Gairdner International Award.
</p>
<p>
 What this university lacks in breadth it more than makes up for in depth. There are other schools that have faculties of comparable distinction spread out over all of their respective departments, but few schools can match Rockefeller University’s incredible concentration of talent within the frontiers of medical science.

<p>
 The University of Colorado, whose flagship campus is located in Boulder just north of Denver, sits against the backdrop of the Rocky Mountains—one of the most spectacular settings of any college campus.
</p>
<p>
 But there is much more to this university than beautiful scenery. The school boasts five Nobel Laureates and more than 50 members of prestigious academic societies.
</p>
<p>
 The University of Colorado at Boulder has a humanitarian-driven outlook. It is one of the top five contributors to the Peace Corps and founded the first Engineers Without Borders chapter.
</p>
<p>
 The University runs 11 different research institutes empowered by the more than $350 million in research funds awarded to faculty. The school offers 3,600 undergraduate courses in roughly 150 fields for 81 different degrees at the bachelor’s level alone.
</p>
<p>
 University of Colorado students come from every state and over 100 foreign countries. They also participate in study-abroad programs in 65 different nations.
</p>
<p>
 Colorado-Boulder alumni have found success in fields from theology and ethics (Baptist theologian Stanley J. Grenz) to statesmanship and politics (President of Liberia and Nobel Peace Prize winner, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf).

<p>
 As the oldest public school in America, the University of North Carolina (UNC) combines the long-standing traditions and prestige more typical of a private school with the economic heft and intellectual prowess of a big state school.
</p>
<p>
 UNC—whose flagship campus is located in the “Research Triangle” town of Chapel Hill—has just under 30,000 students who routinely participate in 325 study-abroad programs in 70 countries.
</p>
<p>
 The university was listed first on
 <em>
  Princeton Review
 </em>
 ’s “Top 10 Best Value Public Colleges for 2014” list, ranked the fifth-best public school by
 <em>
  U.S. News &amp; World Report
 </em>
 for the 14th straight year, and slotted #46 in the world according by London-based
 <em>
  Times Higher Education.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 UNC also cycles through a staggering number of research dollars. The National Institutes of Health awarded the university over $428 million in 2014, while another $141.5 million went to various UNC centers and institutes. Last year the university spent a total of $792.7 million on research supporting over 10,000 researchers, professors, scientists, and various other UNC staff.

<p>
 The University of British Columbia (UBC) consistently ranks among the world’s top 40 research universities, and likewise among the top 20 public universities.
</p>
<p>
 The school has produced seven Nobel Laureates, 65 Olympic medals, 68 Rhodes Scholars, and 180 Royal Society of Canada members. Both Kim Campbell and Charles Joseph Clark—two of Canada’s Prime Ministers—also came out of UBC.
</p>
<p>
 The school’s great size (over 58,000 students and 5,130 faculty members) contributes to its vast alumni network of over 300,000 people spread out over 120 countries.
</p>
<p>
 The school induces C$12.7 billion worth of economic impact on a yearly basis, and uses a C$2 billion operating budget. Up until now, 158 different companies have spun off of UBC-fnanced research.
</p>
<p>
 The school is spread across two campuses, the larger of which is located in Vancouver and is surrounded by beautiful mountain scenery. The second campus is in the city of Kelowna in the Okanagan Valley.
</p>

</aside>
<p>
 The University of Manchester’s 38,000 students and over 4,400 academic and research staff make this school the largest single campus-university in the United Kingdom.
</p>
<p>
 The school has many illustrious accomplishments to its credit, including 25 Nobel Laureates. Several famous scientific experiments were performed here, such as Ernest Rutherford’s historic Gold Foil Experiment proving that the so-called “atom” has an internal structure (a nucleus).
</p>
<p>
 Alan Turing laid the conceptual foundations for the field of computer science at Manchester, and later on it was here that the world’s first supercomputer was built. This university is also responsible for the discovery of graphene. Britain’s Research Assessment Exercise found nearly two-thirds of Manchester’s work to be either world-leading or internationally excellent.
</p>
<p>
 Over 90 percent of graduates directly enter employment or further studies.
</p>
<p>
 And as if all this success were not enough, Manchester has just invested £750 million into upgrading its facilities, and plans to spend a further £1 billion by 2022. This will be the greatest investment ever implemented into any university in the U.K.

 The University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB) is a young school, barely a century old. But in the last 60 years, it has surged onto the world scene and become internationally renowned.
</p>
<p>
 The university’s 21,500 students and 1,100 faculty enjoy one of the most aesthetically stunning campuses in the world.
 <em>
  Newsweek
 </em>
 has written of UCSB: “If there’s a more beautiful campus than this one at the edge of the Pacific, we haven’t seen it.”
</p>
<p>
 The current faculty include five Nobel Prize Laureates since 1998, as well as members of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the National Academy of Engineering, as well as recipients of the Fields Medal and the Millennium Technology Prize. These first-class intellects pursue research at the school’s 12 national research centers.
</p>
<p>
 This rapid rise to prominence was rewarded in 1995, when UCSB joined the 62-school Association of American Universities, an honor which less than two percent of North American Universities enjoy.

 The University of Paris-Sud (also known as “Paris Onze”) is an ancient school founded in the 12th century. It is in many ways reminiscent of the city it calls home.
</p>
<p>
 Just as Paris is both one of the cultural capitals of the world and simultaneously advancing in the ever-evolving information age, so too Paris XI combines its historic linage with a bold future.
</p>
<p>
 One hundred thirty-two nationalities are represented within the student body’s vibrant, 28,000-strong membership. The school also attracts 1,900 teachers and 2,500 researchers.
</p>
<p>
 These people advance their work in over 100 laboratories and produce 5,000 international publications annually. Most of this body of work is cited at above the average rate. Paris XI has also produced two Nobel Prize Laureates and four Fields Medalists.
</p>
<p>
 The university’s Industrial and Commercial Activity Office regularly produces 50 patents a year. Most of the patents are in cutting-edge hard science such as physics, engineering, and medicine.
</p>
<p>
 Paris XI earns €19 million each year through contract research.

 The University of Maryland (UMD) is the leading research center in its state.
</p>
<p>
 UMD’s flagship school is located on a beautiful 1250-acre campus in College Park, Maryland, which is effectively a suburb of Washington, D.C. The school is only nine miles from the White House, the Library of Congress, the Smithsonian Institution, and the National Archives. Students work with federal agencies, labs, NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
</p>
<p>
 In 2013, the school’s Food Recovery Network received its first large grant through Sodexo. Now, this organization provides food for hungry people in 53 colleges across 20 states. UMD pioneered the hugely successful living-learning programs, which have given students hands-on experience in fields as diverse as entrepreneurship and cybersecurity.
</p>
<p>
 The faculty includes members of various national academies, Pulitzer Prize winners, and Nobel Laureates. UMD researchers have worked alongside NASA on multiple space missions, including Voyagers I and II and the Deep Impact missions.
</p>
<p>
 UMD’s environmental researchers are currently working to restore the Chesapeake Bay.

 The University of Melbourne is both the oldest and the leading university in Australia. The school sits next to Melbourne’s center of commerce, and consequently benefits from all the culture and opportunity that a city which has been called “the fourth best city for college students” affords.
</p>
<p>
 The University offers over 340 graduate tracks. One can study everything from professional degrees in law and medicine, to research programs in various sciences.
</p>
<p>
 This is why every year 52,000 students—12,000 of whom are foreigners representing 129 different countries—come to Melbourne. This healthy research environment is one reason why Melbourne gave the world its first bionic ear and is currently developing the first bionic eye.
</p>
<p>
 The school belongs to several prestigious university groups, such as the Asia-Pacific Rim and the Group of Eight. The university has refocused its research directives towards discerning three broad issues: our place/purpose, promoting well-being, and supporting sustainability.
</p>
<p>
 Melbourne actively seeks to engage public discourse through its biennial Festival of Ideas and public lecture program.

<p>
 Founded in 1583, the University of Edinburgh is one of the oldest colleges in the English-speaking world. Its list of historic luminaries includes Adam Smith, David Hume, Charles Darwin, James Clerk Maxwell, and Alexander Graham Bell.
</p>
<p>
 The school has also produced heads of state for Canada, Malawi, Syria, Nicaragua, South Korea, Tanzania, and of course, the United Kingdom.
</p>
<p>
 Edinburgh scientists cloned Dolly the Sheep (the first cloned mammal), while Peter Higgs created his theory of the Higgs Boson here. Scientists at this university created the first genetically engineered hepatitis B vaccine, and helped design the first industrial-assembly robot.
</p>
<p>
 Students can study 500 degree programs spread throughout 100 disciplines. Edinburgh has the largest proportion of international students (two-thirds of the world’s nations are represented in the student body) of any school in Scotland, and participates in many foreign exchange programs.
</p>
<p>
 During the past five years, the school has invested £80 million in improving educational facilities. Students can enjoy all these opportunities right in the middle of Scotland’s beautiful capital.

<p>
 For many scientists around the world, winning the Nobel Prize in their field is equivalent to an athlete’s winning an Olympic gold medal, or to a politician’s being elected President or Prime Minister.
</p>
<p>
 Five researchers affiliated with the Karolinska have received the Nobel Prize, all right—but more interestingly, it is here that the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine has been awarded every year since 1895 (except during World War II).
</p>
<p>
 This world-class medical science center—located in a suburb of Stockholm—produces over 40 percent of the medical research done in Sweden. It was here that in 1915 researchers discovered the sedimentation reaction (ESR), which remains a useful diagnostic tool to this day.
</p>
<p>
 The Karolinska was also the first to develop methods for the production of pure insulin and non-toxic heparin and other blood thinners. The institute also conducted important studies on the impact of the fluoridation of drinking water on public health, the use radiation to examine blood vessels, and the purification of myoglobin.
</p>
<p>
 Finally, it was here that the first pacemaker was implanted into a live person, and the foundations for mitochondrial medicine were laid.

 This illustrious list of contributions to medicine continues unabated into the present and will continue for the foreseeable future.

 The University of California at Irvine shares many traits with its sister schools in the University of California public research system. It is young (founded in 1965) and large (over 29,000 students), and has rapidly climbed the ranks from an unknown entity to one of the world’s premier research universities.
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Times Higher Education
 </em>
 ranks UC Irvine as the number one university under 50 years old, and it was the youngest school to enter the Association of American Universities.
</p>
<p>
 Its yearly contribution of outside funding now exceeds $300 million per year. Its endowment is rapidly expanding, having nearly reached its $1 billion fundraising goal set for its 50th anniversary next year.
</p>
<p>
 These growing assets allow the school to develop cutting-edge technology, such as new extremely lightweight but strong materials in resilient micro-lattice metal, or the work of famous computer scientists like Deva Ramanan.
</p>
<p>
 UC Irvine also runs first-class professional schools. Its business school is now respected as one of the best in the world and is particularly known for employing many female professors, while the university’s law school is now ranked among the top 10 for scholarly publications.

 Founded in 1386, Heidelberg University is Germany’s oldest research university. The school has also used a combination of research-based teaching and effective doctoral training to become one of Europe’s most respected science schools.
</p>
<p>
 Heidelberg focuses on four broad areas of research: materials and structures; molecular and cellular pattern formation; self-organization and regulation; and global culture.
</p>
<p>
 The school also runs the interdisciplinary Centre for Advanced Study and works alongside independent research centers, including the German Cancer Research Center and the Max Planck Institute.
</p>
<p>
 The school’s 30,000 students study and work in 12 different faculties and can choose from 160 different programs. This incredibly wide range of topics of study is unparalleled in Germany, and further enhances the institution’s ability to do interdisciplinary research.
</p>
<p>
 Heidelberg is also plugged into a worldwide collection of over 400 research universities. It is a member of the League of European Research Universities, the Coimbra Group, and the European University Association. The school also has a satellite campus in Latin America and offers courses in various other locations.
</p>
<p>
 Roughly 20 percent of both the student body and the researchers are international. The school is also connected to a staggering 55 Nobel Prizes, as well as numerous other faculty awards.

 The Ludwig Maximilian University Munich—or the “University of Munich,” for short—is a leading European research university over half a millennia in age.
</p>
<p>
 The university was chosen by the German government’s Excellence Initiative as a university of excellence. Seven hundred forty professors and 4,750 academic staff conduct research via its many laboratories and medical facilities.
</p>
<p>
 Unlike many younger schools which have a far stronger tendency to focus on the hard sciences, the University of Munich also maintains an impressive emphasis on the humanities. For example, it has two separate theology departments—one Protestant and the other Catholic—that work side-by-side with its Philosophy department.
</p>
<p>
 Half of the university’s 18 faculties are dedicated to studying various aspects of culture. The school offers 150 subjects for its 48,000 students, 5 percent of whom (about 6,800) are foreigners.
</p>
<p>
 The school’s operating budget is an impressive €488.6 million, which leaves plenty of room to still focus on the hard sciences.
</p>
<p>
 This is one reason why Munich has produced 34 Nobel Prizes, and has 1,800 doctors treating over 500,000 patients each year.

 Rutgers—officially, the State University of New Jersey—is one of the nine colonial colleges built in America before 1776.
</p>
<p>
 The School is centrally located in between New York City and Philadelphia, and consequently well positioned to tap into either city’s substantial economic and cultural opportunities. The flagship Rutgers campus in New Brunswick benefits from a working relationship with its sister campuses in Camden and Newark, as well as a partnership with New Jersey’s premier medical school, the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, also in Newark.
</p>
<p>
 Rutgers has long been considered one of the most diverse colleges in the U.S., with a 40,000-plus member student body drawing from a wide range of economic, social, and national backgrounds. The university is blessed with a first-class faculty that includes an Abel Prize winner, MacArthur Fellows, Guggenheim Fellows, Pulitzer Prize winners, and 37 members of various national academies.
</p>
<p>
 Rutgers is a member of the Association of American Universities and the international Committee on Institutional Cooperation. Each year it spends $430 on research in the life sciences alone, and it generates $304 million in contracts and externally sponsored research grants, making the university an internationally recognized research leader.

  TU Munich is #53 in The 100 Best Universities in the World!
 </a>
</aside>
<p>
 The Technical University of Munich (TUM) benefits from its good company: It is centrally located in one of Europe’s cultural gems and neighbors the University of Munich.
</p>
<p>
 But unlike its fellow Munich university, TUM is much more focused on the sciences. Its 500 professors, 9,000 staff, and 36,000 students focus on engineering, natural science, life science, medicine, and economics.
</p>
<p>
 In 2006, TUM was selected by the Science Council and the German Research Foundation as an “Elite University.” The school is responsible for 13 Nobel Laureates.
</p>
<p>
 But perhaps a better indicator of TUM’s success is the transformation it has led in the German state of Bavaria. Before the school’s long list of scientific accomplishments, the region was mainly known for agriculture; now, the state has become one of Europe’s centers of scientific research and technological innovation as more and more companies flock to Munich.
</p>
<p>
 In addition to TUM, the Bavarian capital is now home to several other scientific research centers, including the Center for Digital Technology and Management and the Max Planck Institute Munich.

 Vanderbilt University is one of the major academic institutions in the southern U.S. Its 12,000 students enjoy such a beautiful campus populated by more than 300 tree and shrub varieties that it has been named a “national arboretum.”
</p>
<p>
 The school has an impressive 8:1 student-to-faculty ratio, is a member of the Association of American Universities, and has produced six Nobel Prize Laureates.
</p>
<p>
 Vanderbilt has a $5.3 billion endowment and a yearly operating budget of $4 billion, which is why the university can spend such substantial resources on its projects. In 2013, it invested $573.1 into research, while its hospital spent $843.6 million.
</p>
<p>
 Vanderbilt advances science through many first-class institutes such as the Center for Medicine Health and Society, the Treatment and Research Institute for Autism Spectrum Disorders, and the Institute for Space and Defense Electronics.
</p>
<p>
 In addition to these first-rate resources, scholars here enjoy a research library with more than 4.4 million volumes.

 The University of California at Davis is a significantly sized state school with over 34,000 students and 222,000 living alumni. It offers over 100 undergraduate majors and 90 graduate programs, many of which are nationally and internationally respected.
</p>
<p>
 The university has substantial resources which include an $807 million endowment and an annual $754 million research budget. UC Davis Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital treats 45,000 animals a year, while its Health System treats 6 million people.
</p>
<p>
 In an effort to further sustainability research, UC Davis built the West Village. This facility was designed to be America’s largest zero net energy community and now serves as a model for sustainable housing development.
</p>
<p>
 The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation recently awarded UC Davis $16 million for research in developing highly nutritious and cost-effective dietary supplements to prevent malnutrition in developing countries.

  Univ. of Zurich is #56 in The 100 Best Universities in the World!
 </a>
</aside>
<p>
 With 26,000 students, the University of Zurich is the largest university in Switzerland. Given its substantial student population, it is not surprising that the university also offers the widest range of academic programs of any school in its country (over 100 to date).
</p>
<p>
 The university’s academics are divided into seven broad departments, ranging from science through professional schools to the humanities. Undergraduate courses are taught in Swiss Standard German, although the master’s degrees in science and several other programs are taught in English.
</p>
<p>
 The school has produced a dozen Nobel Laureates to its credit, including the 20th century’s embodiment of science itself, Albert Einstein (who also studied at Zurich’s other famous institution of higher learning, ETH).
</p>
<p>
 The University of Zurich runs 160 institutes and clinics, including an especially noteworthy research project known as the Swiss National Super Computer Centre. The University of Zurich has also been recognized for its contribution to science through its inclusion in the League of European Research Universities.
</p>
<p>
 But Zurich is more than just a research center; it has also taken up the challenge of sharing its knowledge with the general public. The school runs 12 museums, constantly rotates through public lecture series, and regularly produces publications for a general audience in order to share as much knowledge with as many as possible.

 As early as 695 AD, students began studying at a school in the city of Utrecht, a community founded by a monk of the same name.
</p>
<p>
 Although the modern Utrecht University bears little resemblance to its humble beginnings, it still carries on both the tradition expected of an ancient institution and the curiosity fundamental to education, making it one of the most deeply respected universities in the Netherlands.
</p>
<p>
 The school is divided into seven faculties: humanities, law, geosciences, social and behavioral sciences, science, medicine, and veterinary medicine.
</p>
<p>
 Utrecht offers a wide range of subjects both in Dutch and English, including 45 undergraduate programs (four in English), 153 graduate programs (81 in English), and 32 teacher training programs (both Dutch and English). Twelve Nobel Prize winners have come through Utrecht, as well as 14 Spinoza Laureates.
</p>
<p>
 The university can capitalize on a substantial student body of over 30,000 students, 1,500 of whom are exchange students from 118 different countries.
</p>
<p>
 In addition to its size, Utrecht also benefits from an impressive €765 million endowment.

 Even by the standards of world-class, state-run research universities, Pennsylvania State University (universally known as “Penn State”) is utterly massive. It takes 24 campuses to house its 100,000-plus students and 17,000 faculty and staff statewide. The flagship campus is found in the centrally located, purpose-built town of University Park.
</p>
<p>
 In many ways Penn State is more of a state-wide unified system of colleges working under one federation than a single university. The university runs one of the largest graduate schools in the U.S., and cycles through more than $2 million in research every day.
</p>
<p>
 In addition to the over $800 million spent annually on research, Penn State also generates $100 million in industry and private funding each year. Its hospital-integrated medical school treats over 1 million patients annually.
</p>
<p>
 Penn State’s more than half-million alumni have access to the largest required-dues alumni association in the U.S., with over 275 branches across the globe. The school also runs an online campus and the world’s largest student-organized and -led philanthropic society.

 Historically, King’s College London (“Kings” or “KCL”) has stood at the forefront of extending higher education to women and men in lower social economic classes.
</p>
<p>
 The school has developed and merged with several other respected academic institutions over the years, including the United Medical and Dental Schools of Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospitals (the world’s first professional school for nursing), Chelsea College, Queen Elizabeth College, and the Institute of Psychiatry.
</p>
<p>
 Now, this unified conglomerate forms a first-class research university with an endowment exceeding £154 million. KCL is connected to 12 Nobel Prizes.
</p>
<p>
 It was here that the great poet John Keats received his training (in medicine), and here that the civil rights activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner Desmond Tutu began his fight against apartheid.
</p>
<p>
 The distinguished physicist James Clerk Maxwell conducted his pioneering research here as well (proving that magnetism, electricity, and light are all different aspects of the same physical phenomenon).

 Uppsala University was the first university in Scandinavia. This Swedish school has grown to include over 40,000 students studying in over nine facilities supported by €549.6 million.
</p>
<p>
 The university is affiliated with multiple prestigious international university collaborations, such as Coimbra, U4, Matariki, SANORD, Nordic Centre India, Nordic Centre Fudan University, and the Baltic University Programme, as well as an especially strong exchange program with the Collège de France.
</p>
<p>
 Uppsala is also a leader in the national database Swedish ScienceNet, a joint program among 10 Swedish schools that constantly updates the world on emerging empirical discoveries. The school also offers over 40 international master’s degrees in English.
</p>
<p>
 This strong collaboration, combined with the school’s first-class resources, is why Uppsala has produced eight Nobel Prizes, most of which are in physics and chemistry. The school also networks with many more Nobel Prize winners, as it is a long-standing tradition for the Laureates to visit Uppsala in conjunction with the Nobel banquet in Stockholm.

 Carnegie Mellon University was founded in 1900 for the sake of expanding the scientific enterprise, and has continuously pursued research among the hard sciences ever since.
</p>
<p>
 The Association of University Technology Managers found that the school produced the highest number of start-up companies per dollar of any university.
 <em>
  U.S. News &amp; World Report
 </em>
 called it the #1 school for computer science and #5 for engineering in 2014.
</p>
<p>
 Students here are known for both their contributions to technical fields and their ability to harness those developments for successful entrepreneurial ventures. This has contributed to Carnegie Mellon’s development across the globe.
</p>
<p>
 The university now has three campuses. The historic campus is located in Pittsburgh, while two new campuses have been added, one in Silicon Valley and the other in Doha, Qatar.
</p>
<p>
 Carnegie Mellon University has obviously developed quickly in its relatively short life span. It now has a $1.4 billion endowment, 13,000 students, 1,500 faculty, and 131 research centers.
</p>

  Univ. of Bristol is #63 in The 100 Best Universities in the World!
 </a>
</aside>
<p>
 The University of Bristol attracts students from over 100 nations to the beautiful city that shares its name. The school boasts 11 Nobel Laureates, 21 Fellows of the Academy of Medical Science, 15 Fellows of the British Academy, 11 Fellows of the Academy of Royal Academy of Engineering, and 40 Fellows of the Royal Society.
</p>
<p>
 Bristol is also affiliated with multiple prestigious university groups, such as the Russel Group, Coimbra Group, and the Worldwide Universities Network. The school also sends students to over 500 other European Universities through the Erasmus University Charter.
</p>
<p>
 Bristol is powered by a healthy £459.2 million endowment. And unlike too many institutions in these financially troubled times, it cycles through £100.6 million of capital investment, leaving a stable £12.5 million surplus, so that students may be confident that the school’s research activities are secure.
</p>
<p>
 Bristol’s research now involves both the Bristol Laboratory for Advanced Dynamics Engineering (BLADE)—which is the most advanced center for studying aircraft design in Europe—and the development of a new type of computer on the principle of quantum information processing (“qubits”).

</aside>
<p>
 The University of Geneva was founded in 1559 by one of history’s great theologians, John Calvin. It has since blossomed into a major center for scientific research.
</p>
<p>
 The second-largest university in Switzerland, Geneva is included in the League of European Research Universities and the Coimbra group. It offers over 280 degrees and runs six National Centres of Competence in Research in subjects such as genetics, materials with novel electronic properties, chemical biology, affective sciences, synaptic bases of mental disease, and overcoming vulnerabilities in a life-course perspective.
</p>
<p>
 Geneva works with nearly 100 other research universities and employs almost 4,000 researchers from 113 nations. It receives well over SFr100 million each year from the Swiss National Science Foundation and SFr24 million from the European Commission for research.
</p>
<p>
 The university contributes over 10 articles a day to the world of the peer-reviewed scientific journals. During the past 10 years, it has produced 20 start-up companies, 150 license agreements, 350 invention announcements, and 600 industrial research agreements.
</p>
<p>
 Thirty-one University of Geneva researchers have received a European Grant of Excellence.

  ENS is #67 in The 100 Best Universities in the World!
 </a>
</aside>
<p>
 Founded in 1793 on Enlightenment principles, the École Normale Supérieure (ENS)—the name means “Higher Normal School”—is a product of the French Revolution. It was re-chartered a few years later by Napoleon himself.
</p>
<p>
 The ENS has since become a leading French university with a unique character. Whereas many schools pursue influence through sheer weight of numbers, ENS has remained small, even by college—let alone university—standards. It has a mere 2,700-member student body, which includes about 650 doctoral students, and only 800 faculty members.
</p>
<p>
 But what ENS foregoes in size it makes up for in elite reputation. The school attracts over 300 top international students from 46 countries, offers 60 master’s degrees, and 23 doctoral programs. These degree programs are spread across 15 teaching and research departments, and feed the college’s 21 research centers.
</p>
<p>
 ENS’s library system consists of 12 smaller libraries that house some 850,000 volumes combined. The prestigious school has produced 13 Nobel Prize winners and an astounding 10 Fields Medalists, making it one of the most significant contributors to mathematics in the world.

</aside>
<p>
 McGill University, located in the multicultural metropolis of Montreal, is one of the leading schools in Canada. Its 38,500 students study in 300 buildings, and its quarter-million alumni are spread across 180 countries.
</p>
<p>
 McGill produces more Rhodes Scholars than any other Canadian university. It also has the highest percentage of doctoral students, and 20 percent of its student body consists of international students drawn from 150 nations.
</p>
<p>
 McGill invests roughly C$500 million each year. Much of this funding comes from the university’s participation in entrepreneur-backed collaborations that utilize its 1,600 researchers, 8,000 graduate students/postdoctoral students, and its 46 research centers.
</p>
<p>
 These partnerships run from minor support for preexisting projects to licensing very specific research initiatives. These collaborative efforts have led McGill to make significant contributions to science—most recently through the mapping of the brain’s motor cortex.
</p>
<p>
 The school’s faculty and alumni account for nine Nobel Prizes.

</aside>
<p>
 The University of Oslo is the oldest school in Norway. It has 27,000 students, 7,000 employees, and 3,000 Ph.D. students studying in eight faculties.
</p>
<p>
 The university houses the Viking Ship Museum and a library with 3.6 million holdings, and is also home to eight National Centres of Excellence, as well as Centres for Research-based Innovation and Environment-friendly Energy Research.
</p>
<p>
 Oslo can pursue these numerous research projects with its substantial government funding that helps produce its NOK652.8 million endowment.
</p>
<p>
 But Oslo is more than just a Norwegian gem. It also offers over 800 courses in English, has received seven individual grants from European Union research projects, and has contributed to five Nobel Prize winners.
</p>
<p>
 The school is particularly noteworthy for its strong connection to peace studies. Between 1947 and 1989, it hosted the ceremony for the Nobel Peace Prize and consequently is the only university to have hosted a Nobel Prize Ceremony.
</p>
<p>
 Johan Galtung, the founder of the academic field of peace and conflict studies, founded the world’s first chair in that discipline here at Oslo; the famous explorer, humanitarian, and Nobel Peace Prize winner Fridtjof Nansen taught here as well.
</p>
<p>
 The University of Oslo also awards the prestigious Abel Prize in mathematics annually.

<p>
 Ghent University was founded in 1817 as the first Flemish-speaking university in Belgium.
</p>
<p>
 Belgium is a biethnic, bilingual country (French and Netherlandish). Moreover, the Belgian capital, Brussels, is also the seat of the European government—which makes the city effectively the capital of Europe. These facts place the University of Ghent near the center of pan-European cultural and social change.
</p>
<p>
 The university has 41,000 students and 9,000 staff members working in 11 faculties with over 120 departments. Each year it brings in an impressive €410 million.
</p>
<p>
 In 2010, Ghent established five multidisciplinary research partnerships. The university runs many research facilities, such as its world-famous Laboratory of Molecular Biology. This lab was the first to demonstrate that genomic DNA can form a physical ring, was the first to complete a gene nucleotide sequence, and has cloned human cytokine genes. It is currently working on a vaccine for influenza.
</p>
<p>
 Given these accomplishments, it is not surprising that the University of Ghent has played a major role in the development of organic chemistry. Additionally, 13 Ghent research groups are affiliated with the Sustainable Energy Technologies (SET) organization.
</p>
<p>
 The school also works side-by-side with the University Hospital of Ghent.

 The Hebrew University of Jerusalem opened its doors less than a century ago (in 1925), with the backing of illustrious intellectuals like Albert Einstein, Martin Buber, and Sigmund Freud. Since then, it has quickly established itself as one of the world’s premier research universities.
</p>
<p>
 The university serves 23,000 students from 70 countries. It has produced eight Nobel Prize Laureates, a Fields Medalist, and 263 Israel Prize winners.
</p>
<p>
 The Hebrew University dominates higher education in Israel. The majority of the nation’s Ph.D. holders earned their degree here, and a third of Israel’s research grants go to scholars affiliated with the school. The Hebrew University has also developed an international presence, with dozens of exchange programs and partnerships with over 150 other universities.
</p>
<p>
 The Hebrew University has many strengths, but has taken special advantage of Israel’s growing biotech industry. Israel in general, and the Hebrew University in particular, have become leading centers for the integration of biology and engineering.

 As its name implies, Boston University (BU) lies squarely in the middle of America’s college Mecca.
</p>
<p>
 The greater Boston area is home not just to BU, but also to Harvard, MIT, Northeastern, Boston College, Tufts, Brandeis, and numerous other schools which altogether form the highest concentration of academic institutions in the U.S. This gives BU students innumerable opportunities to study with as diverse a group of scholars as can be found.
</p>
<p>
 But BU does more than just network with its prominent neighbors. It also equips its over 33,000 students, almost half of whom are graduate students, with 324 academic buildings, 23 libraries, and a staggering 2,285 laboratories on its several campuses.
</p>
<p>
 The university attracts students from all 50 states and over 130 nations. It boasts an impressive 12.6:1 student-to-faculty ratio, and holds close to $five billion in assets.
</p>
<p>
 BU’s faculty includes six Nobel Laureates, six Pulitzer Prize winners, and three MacArthur Fellows. The school has also produced numerous famous alumni, including singer Joan Baez, actress Julianne Moore, and civil rights activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner, Martin Luther King, Jr.

</aside>
<p>
 Aarhus University is the largest institution of higher education in Denmark, with 44,500 students (5,000 of whom are foreign) and 6,000 academic staff. It is also the second-oldest.
</p>
<p>
 Aarhus has produced a Nobel Prize Laureate in chemistry and another in economics. The classic architecture of its University Park campus has become iconic in Danish architecture. The school focuses on four broad areas: art, science and technology, health and business, and social science.
</p>
<p>
 Aarhus University operates out of campuses in Aarhus, Copenhagen, and Herning. The city of Aarhus is located on the mainland of Europe—what one might call the the “southernmost tip of Scandinavia”—which makes the university an ideal bridge between the Nordic countries and the rest of Europe.
</p>
<p>
 Several major rankings have recognized Aarhus University’s recent rise to prominence. The 2013 National Taiwan University Rankings considered it the #86 best university in the world, while the Leiden Ranking placed it at #77.
</p>
<p>
 The school has produced many successful individuals, such as Bjarne Stroustrup, the designer of the C++ computer program, and Anders Fogh Rasmussen, former Prime Minister of Denmark.

 </a>
</aside>
<p>
 Nestled in the historic town of Providence, Rhode Island, Brown University is the seventh-oldest university in the U.S.
</p>
<p>
 This beautiful campus with its surrounding community is a federally listed architectural district with a high concentration of vintage buildings, which gives the urban Brown a small-town collegial atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
 But despite its long history, this Ivy League school has maintained a relatively small, intimate setting with about 9,000 students (including undergraduates, graduate students, and medical school students) and 700-member faculty.
</p>
<p>
 Brown nevertheless boldly marches into the future, filing for close to 100 patents a year, while Brown University Library’s special collections department alone holds over 3 million items of rare and historic value.
</p>
<p>
 The school spends over $170 million each year on research. It is also affiliated with the prestigious Marine Biological Laboratory on Cape Cod, which has 54 Nobel Prizes to its credit.
</p>
<p>
 Brown University’s small student size and impressive $3.2 billion endowment combine to produce a tremendous ratio of resources per student.

 The Technion-Israel Institute of Technology is the leading institution for empirical inquiry in Israel. With over 50 scientific research centers, this school has spearheaded Israel’s transformation into one of the leading science centers in the world.
</p>

 Three Nobel Laureates teach the 9,529 undergraduate, 2,384 masters, and 943 doctorial students. Over 70 percent of both the nation’s founders and managers of high-tech industries graduated from Technion.
</p>
<p>
 This has led to incredible development. Israel now has the highest density of high-tech start-up companies anywhere in the world outside Silicon Valley. Eighty percent of Israel’s NASDAQ companies are run by Technion graduates. As a result, 54 percent of Israel’s exports and 26 percent of its imports are now in the high-tech sector.
</p>
<p>
 Israel now has the highest percentage of engineers or scientists of any nation in the world, with 135 out of every 10,000. By way of comparison, the U.S. comes in at a distant second, with 85 out of 10,000. Israel also has nearly doubled the percentage of its workers who are pursuing research and development—which is also almost double what either the U.S. or Japan produces.

<p>
 It looks as if Israel will remain at the forefront of science for the foreseeable future—and Technion will remain at the forefront of Israel.

 Some research universities take a scattershot approach: they take as many students as they can in order to have the resources to attack big scale research projects by sheer weight of numbers.
</p>
<p>
 Rice University has taken the opposite approach. It only has 643 full-time, 136 part-time, and 147 adjunct faculty. This small faculty teaches a modest 3,920 undergraduate and 2,567 graduate students in just eight schools.
</p>
<p>
 But despite being one of the smaller schools in the top 100, Rice is still an elite research university. Ninety-seven percent of the full-time faculty have a terminal degree in their field.
</p>
<p>
 The students enjoy their instruction with an impressive 6:1 student-to-faculty ratio, with an average class size of just 14. Moreover, only one out of every 16 applicants is accepted.
</p>
<p>
 Those who do find a place at Rice enjoy an endowment of $772,147 per full-time student. The university spends $94 million each year on research.
</p>
<p>
 Unlike many schools, Rice opens research opportunities to undergraduates, 67 percent of whom participate in research before graduating.

<p>
 Many of the schools in this ranking are ancient academies that have shaped the history of science since the enlightenment. The University of California at Santa Cruz, however, will be celebrating its 50th anniversary next year.
</p>
<p>
 So, how did such a young school earn a spot among such illustrious company? Well, for starters Santa Cruz has grown substantially despite its youth. It now has 15,000 undergraduate and 1,500 graduate students who study in 65 majors and 41 graduate programs.
</p>
<p>
 But Santa Cruz has done more than just attract large numbers of students; It has also built a world-class faculty. Its instructors include 14 members of national academy of sciences, 26 members of the American Academy of the Arts and Sciences, and 35 members of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
</p>
<p>
 In 2003, the university initiated a $330-million program to develop a new university-affiliated research center. Now, the school’s research is organized into two separate research units: the Institute of Marine Sciences and the Santa Cruz Institute of Particle Physics.

 Older readers will recognize Bonn as the pleasant city on the Rhine where Ludwig van Beethoven was born in 1770 and which served as the capital of the western part of a divided Germany following World War II.
</p>
<p>
 The surrounding Rhineland was incorporated into Prussia by the Congress of Vienna following Napoleon’s defeat in 1815—which explains how the University of Bonn came to be founded by the Prussian king, Friedrich Wilhelm III, three years later in 1818.
</p>
<p>
 Thus steeped in history, today the University of Bonn is home to a major research university with 30,000 students, 4,000 of whom are international. Its 500 professors and various other researchers engage in over 1,500 projects.
</p>
<p>
 The university owns or uses over 350 buildings throughout the city of Bonn, although seven particular facilities form its core. The university, with total expenditures of €570 million, is also affiliated with multiple teaching hospitals.
</p>
<p>
 The University of Bonn brings in €156 million through third-party funding. Its medical-related enterprises run 14 collaborative research centers, 17 research units, and five research training groups.
</p>
<p>
 Partnered with 56 universities in Europe, America, Asia, and Australia, Bonn has produced two Nobel Prizes and holds 5.5 million items in its 100 libraries.

<p>
 Founded in 1425 by Pope Martin V, the Catholic University of Louvain is the oldest Catholic university in the world. It is also the oldest university in the Low Countries. The quintessential humanist, Desiderius Erasmus, lectured at this school.
</p>
<p>
 In 1968, this ancient university split into two parts: a Dutch-speaking (KU Leuven) and a French-speaking part (Université Catholique de Louvain). The French-speaking school subsequently relocated to the suburb of Louvain-la-Neuve.
</p>
<p>
 KU Leuven is Belgium’s largest university, both in terms of students and research funding/expenditures. It attracts 41,000 students, 8,000 of whom are international. Also, 6,500 researchers from 120 countries work here. Combined, these groups represent 140 nationalities.
</p>
<p>
 KU Leuven is a charter member of the league of European Research Universities. Its annual research expenditure is €418 million and the overall endowment is €950 million.
</p>
<p>
 Despite the fact that its library burned down in both world wars, the school now has 30 auxiliary libraries with 4.3 million volumes. The school partners with a teaching hospital and has produced multiple Nobel Prize Laureates.

 The Free University of Amsterdam (also known by its Dutch initials, “VU,” pronounced “voo”) was founded by Abraham Kuyper in 1880 as the first private college in the Netherlands. This theologian, journalist, reformer, and Dutch Prime Minister instilled a deep commitment to interdisciplinary thinking that lives on to this day.
</p>
<p>
 Today, the school teaches 25,000 students with the help of 2,150 academic staff. The Free University wishes to live out its Christian values through its three stated goals of diversity, academic community, and vision.
</p>
<p>
 The Free University takes its research very seriously. Each institute must produce a self-assessment every three years. Furthermore, research is evaluated every six years by another, independent assessment group.
</p>
<p>
 This rigorous self-regulation assures that every aspect of the research initiative efficiently produces new peer-reviewed publications, patents, and joint projects integrated with other universities and businesses, as appropriate.
</p>
<p>
 The university’s endowment is just under €500 million.
